# RAW_Socket_Project
Hello everyone. You can use ‍‍‍```RAW Socket``` Project from me! :)

You can create a raw socket and send packets freely.

:warning:Note: This project is not complete now.

You can run this application like this
``` bash
sudo make
sudo ./RAW_Socket.out
```
 or run it in vs-code easily.
